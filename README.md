I would like to express my gratitude to the people at SAL (Scalable Architecture Lab)

This will greatly aid your studies on ECC (Error Correcting Code)

The methods were applied in the following papers **[1-7]** (the code can be found in the SAL repo), so I encourage you to read through the issues, study the papers, examine the experimental code, and consider constructing experimental methodologies based on them.

# 01_Basic
- Basic ECC (Error Correcting Codes)
- Contents: Hamming code, Hsiao code, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) code, RS (Reed-Solomon) code, etc

# 02_Application
- Application for DRAM & sub-systems
- ECC types: On-Die ECC & Rank-Level ECC
- Target DRAM: DDR4, DDR5

# Synthesis (Verilog)
- 01_136_128_SEC: (136, 128) SEC code **[4]**
- 02_104_06_SEC_DED: (104, 96) SEC-DED code **[6]**
- 03_136_128_SEC_BADAEC: (136, 128) SEC-BADAEC code **[4]**
- 04_10_8_RS_SSC: (10, 8) RS SSC (Single Symbol Correcting) code over GF(256) **[7]**
- 05_39_36_RS_SSC_DSD: (39, 36) RS SSC-DSD (Singl Symbol Correcting Double Symbol Detecting) code over GF(256) **[6]**
- SQUID: Reed-Solomon code (Double Symbol Correction using Berlekampâ€“Massey algorithm)
