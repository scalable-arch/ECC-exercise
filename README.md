I would like to express my gratitude to the people at SAL (Scalable Architecture Lab).
This will greatly aid your studies on ECC (Error Correcting Code).
The methods were applied in the following papers **[1-7]** (the code can be found in the SAL repo), so I encourage you to read through the issues, study the papers, examine the experimental code, and consider constructing experimental methodologies based on them.
